# Advanced Algorithmic Implementations in C++

## Overview
This project showcases the implementation of various complex algorithms in C++, emphasizing performance optimization and algorithmic complexity. The project includes three main components:

1. **Bucket Sort with Custom Bucket Generation**: Implementation of an efficient bucket sort algorithm that utilizes custom-defined buckets to manage data distribution and flattening.
2. **Sorting Based on Probability and Criteria Matching**: A sorting algorithm that classifies and orders data based on predefined criteria and probabilities, using complex data structures and iterative sorting.
3. **Matrix Multiplication with Strassen’s Algorithm**: Implementation of the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication, breaking down matrices into sub-blocks for recursive computation, which enhances performance compared to standard methods.

## Features
- **Bucket Sort**: Custom bucket generation and element distribution for sorting, handling unique data sets with varying ranges.
- **Probability-Based Sorting**: Sorting algorithm that matches items based on criteria and uses a combination of maps and sets for data management, ensuring O(F*log(M) + N*log(M*N)) complexity.
- **Strassen's Algorithm for Matrix Multiplication**:
  - Efficiently splits matrices into sub-matrices and applies recursive multiplication to achieve better performance than standard O(n^3) methods.
  - Optimized for matrices with a configurable threshold for switching between Strassen’s algorithm and conventional multiplication.

## Skills Developed
- **Algorithmic Complexity Analysis**: Ensuring each function has clear preconditions, postconditions, and well-documented complexity.
- **Data Structure Utilization**: Leveraging C++ standard containers like vectors, maps, and custom sets to optimize data handling and operations.
- **Memory Management**: Careful handling of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation to prevent leaks and maintain efficiency.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implementing advanced algorithms (e.g., Strassen’s method) to improve the performance of computationally intensive tasks.
- **C++ Programming Best Practices**: Writing clean, modular code with reusable components.

## Technologies Used
- **C++ Standard Library**: Utilized for fundamental operations and data structures.
- **Custom Implementations**: Enhanced performance with specialized utility functions and custom data structures.
- **Matrix and Vector Operations**: Developed for efficient handling and manipulation of large data sets.

This project demonstrates the capability to tackle complex algorithmic challenges, focusing on optimization and effective use of C++ features to achieve efficient results.
